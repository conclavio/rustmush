# 44. Minds, wired through the game — cut notes

One section a unit of [doc 44](44-minds-wired-through-the-game.md) §7. A unit's session replaces its
own "Not built." line with what it built, under these headings: **Built**, **Tests**,
**Divergences**, **Not built**, **Not pinned by a story**, and the open Q-44 defaults it was built
on. Each session edits only its own section, so two units' notes never touch the same lines.

The Registry's pace as a file key, and the two notice drains that stopped on one bad holding
(doc 44 §7.1, Q-44-41; second review, §4c rows 4 and 10). Built on Q-44-41's default, which is
open: the key exists with today's value as its default, and a dev box sets it low.

**Built.**

- **`[tacsim.minds].registry_pulse_ms`.** `mush_config::TacsimMindsCfg.bulk_maintenance_ms` was
  `serde(skip)`, so no file could set the pace of a Registry lease; only the acceptance stories'
  harness could, in code. It is now a file key under the name `registry_pulse_ms` (the Rust
  field keeps its name and is not a key). Absent, it is 1,000 ms, production's second, as doc
  43c records was decided. `MindsConfig::validate` (`crates/tacsim/src/config.rs`) refuses a
  value outside 10 to 60,000 by the key's name, ahead of the bulk model's own check. The key is
  documented, commented, in `mushd.toml.example` and `deploy/instance/mushd.toml.tmpl`, and in
  the key table at the head of `crates/mush-config/src/config.rs`. `tacsim::MindsConfig` itself
  still skips the field in its own serde; the host's mapping (`mush_server::config_ext`) is the
  path a file takes.
- **Both notice drains skip one bad holding.** In `crates/mush-roll/src/commerce/registry_recall/notice.rs`
  and `registry_revocation/notice.rs`, `tick` returned the first error from `own` before the
  cursors were written back, so the next tick read the same page, met the same holding and
  stopped again: every notice behind it waited for ever. Now an error that is one holding's own
  (`one_holding`: `Missing`, `Mismatch`, `Invalid`) skips that holding, emits nothing for it,
  logs it once (`Runtime::note_skipped`, bounded like the remembered notices) and lets the
  cursor pass. An error that is the inventory's (`Unavailable`, `Stale`, `Capacity`) still stops
  the drain where it is, before anything is emitted, to be tried again. `page` had the same
  fault one level up: a row that failed `validate` failed the whole page. Such a row is now
  carried with no recipient, so the cursor passes it.

**Tests.** `mush-config`: `m1b1_the_minds_block_parses_absent_written_and_refuses_a_typo` gains
the key (absent is 1,000; `registry_pulse_ms = 50` parses; `bulk_maintenance_ms` is an unknown
field). `mush-server`: `config_ext`'s refusal table gains 5 and 60,001, each refused by the key's
name, and the mapper carries 50 through to the layer's config. `mush-roll`: one test in each
notice module, `a_bad_holding_is_skipped_and_an_unavailable_inventory_is_not`. Local: `cargo test
-p mush-config` 141 + 14 passed; `cargo test -p mush-roll notice` 3 passed; `cargo test -p
mush-server --lib config_ext` 18 passed; `cargo test -p mush-contract-tests` green; clippy with
warnings denied on mush-roll, mush-config, tacsim and mush-server.

**Divergences.** The unit's row asks for "the measured time a rating takes at both paces". It
was not measured in this cut. The figures on file are `ci.yml`'s (about 1,070 leases a
certificate, about three hours a story at 1,000 ms) and the acceptance stories' (minutes at
their 50 ms). MW.1's bring-up is where a dev box's rating is first timed.

**Not built.** Registry pacing beyond the pulse: a lease still takes 3 to 7 s of work at the
stock pace, and nothing here shortens the work a lease does. The key is not set in
`deploy/dev1` or `deploy/dev2`; MW.1 sets it when it renders the launch.

**Not pinned by a story.** The drains end to end: no rig corrupts one holding and shows the
holder behind it getting their notice. The tests pin which errors skip and which stop, and that
the skipped keys stay bounded. A row that fails `validate` in `page` is not pinned at all.

The story doc 36 owed for SCREEN and SUPPORT flown as delivered orders (doc 44 §7.1; doc 36 cut
GC.0's "Not built"; Q-36-42). No engine code changed: the cut is a test rig and a story.

**Built.**

- **`roster_rig`** (`crates/tacsim/tests/support/field/roster_rig.rs`), the rig that flies a
  detachment's roster into a field in tacsim's own world harness. `fly` is `mush-server`'s
  `pair_field_fixture` on `driving_rig`'s composed world, every step the production command:
  the hire at the Slack Line (`+sortie/crew`, `+sortie/hire`), a leased prospector a slot with
  its operational loans (`+tv/lease go`, `+tv/<n>/permissions go`), the crew brought aboard
  (`+sortie/board`), the voyage to the site, the sub-loan to each NPC
  (`@unitgrant/issue … operate_crew parent=<loan>`), the leader's own boarding
  (`+tv/<n> board`, `+focus`), the plan (`+sortie/draft`, `+sortie/accept`, `@station/handoff`,
  `+sortie/ready`, `+sortie/activate`), each NPC's seat (`+sortie/seat`), the launch
  (`+sortie/launch`) and the refresh until the field command names a leader.
- Its parts are what MW.14a's story needs next: `Plan` takes any billets (a `Leader`, a `Hired`
  crew member by name) and a `commander` by name; `commit` lands whatever a line queued on the
  composed path whoever owns the action (tacsim's, Org's unit grants, Sim's helm hand-off, which
  `driving_rig::drain` drops); `apply_due` lands a due scheduled action on the composed scheduled
  path (Sim's `control_handoff_apply`, the lander doc 36 said such a story needs); `beat` is one
  world second of both; `fence` and `reply` read the order prefill and a sent order's status off
  `+sortie/orders`, as a player's client does.
- **The story** (`crates/tacsim/tests/domain_field/field_mw15.rs`), at 256 on Ahuna Flank and at
  512 on Urvara Reach. A captain leads a mining roster from rig 1 with Ilya Mendes hired into rig
  2. A second captain's armed hull escorts and a third party's armed hull stands off it; the
  escort's `+field/fire` promotes the site and three parties are admitted. Then, by the leader's
  own `ORDER DT:… ` lines:
  1. `2 SCREEN 90`: the order is delivered, stands on Mendes's own frame, the rig turns onto 90
     degrees and the WILCO comes back. The leader drives four cells off and the screen stays on
     its cell and its bearing;
  2. `2 SUPPORT 1`: the rig leaves the cell it screened from, closes to its station on the
     leader's rig, and answers WILCO;
  3. `2 SCREEN 270`: the rig turns onto the new bearing, so the bearing it holds is the order's;
  4. `2 SUPPORT 2` (its own slot): NEGATIVE, and the screen goes on standing.

**Tests.** `field_mw15::mw15_a_rosters_screen_and_support_are_delivered_and_obeyed` and
`…_at_512` in `domain_field`. Local, Windows: 85 s and 81 s, each passing alone. GC.0's two
in-source gates are untouched.

**Divergences.**

- **One NPC flies both orders, in turn.** A Dray-P's bay holds two rigs, so a roster with a
  player leader has one hired NPC (`fly` refuses a third billet). The row's "the screening unit"
  and "the supporting unit" are the same rig under two successive orders, with the screen's hold
  checked while the leader moves away and the supporter's close checked after it.
- **"Keeps to its charge" is the doctrine's station, with the motor's tolerance.** The supporter
  ends within `SUPPORT_STATION_CELLS` (5) of its own plot of the charge plus the kernel motor's
  arrival tolerance; the story allows two cells for that.
- **The escort and the intruder are fixture hulls with players seated** (CF.2's `armed_on` and
  `seat`), not the content's raider on its doctrine, so nobody fires after the opening order and
  the story does not hang on the field's dice. Three parties stand in the field; only the roster
  is under test.
- **The rigs are stood on their cells by a staff hand** after the launch, as every field story
  places its units.

**Not built.** A SUPPORT whose charge is another NPC's rig (it needs a third bay), and SCREEN or
SUPPORT under fire with a Hostile in the screen's arc: the story is about delivery and obedience,
not the stand the doctrine takes. A restart with an order standing.

**Not pinned by a story.** The jammed and the damaged carrier relay holding these two orders back
(FR.5's stories pin that for the orders they fly). A SUPPORT refused for a charge in another party
or outside the field, which GC.0's in-source gate covers and this story covers only for the
recipient's own slot.

## MW.16

Surveyed as [doc 45](45-the-absent-player.md): every way a player can be absent while something of theirs is exposed, what the game does and what an attacker can do today, checked in the tree.
Twenty-five owner questions, Q-45-1 to Q-45-25, open at their defaults; no units of work until they are ruled.
PR #533.

## MW.17

The last decision in the staff view of an NPC (doc 44 §7.1, Q-44-30; first review, finding 8;
second review, §4c row 19).

**Built.** In `crates/mush-npc`:

- **A turn records what woke it.** `NpcHostState::begin_turn` (`runtime.rs`) drains the mailbox,
  so it is the one place that knows; it now writes a `LastDecision` on the NPC's runtime: the
  correlation, when it began, and for the first `LAST_DECISION_WOKE_MAX` (8) stimuli of the batch
  their kind (`Stimulus::kind_name`) and whom each was about. `fire_dialogue` (`module.rs`) adds
  how many public facts and recalled memories the snapshot showed the model
  (`note_decision_context`); guarded and secret facts never cross the async boundary, so the
  count is of public ones.
- **A completion records what the turn came to.** `NpcCompletion::on_complete` writes a
  `DecisionResult`: the model answered with these actions (their tool names), the model did
  nothing, the profile's fallback line with the staff-facing reason (capped at 160 characters),
  or the payload did not decode. A completion for another turn changes nothing
  (`finish_decision`).
- **`@agent/show` prints it**, in two lines after the runtime line (`LastDecision::lines`), and
  `docs/help/npc.md` describes them. The verb is Builder and up, as before.

The record holds kinds, ids and counts. It holds no prompt, no reply and no stimulus text, in
keeping with the audit's rule (`docs/help/llm.md`).

**Tests.** `runtime::tests::mw17_the_last_decision_records_what_woke_a_turn_and_how_it_ended`
(the record, the cap, another turn's completion, the two lines carrying no text) and
`mw17_staff_read_what_woke_a_turn_and_whether_the_model_or_the_fallback_spoke`
(`crates/mush-npc/tests/agents.rs`): through `@agent/show`, a turn in flight, the same turn
answered by the model, the next turn starved of budget and answered by the fallback, and a
player refused the verb. No test makes a provider call. Local: `cargo test -p mush-npc` 150 +
72 + 34 passed; clippy clean with warnings denied.

**Divergences.**

- **The NPC decision call still carries no NPC.** The row asks for `decision_llm.rs` to pass its
  NPC so the per-NPC budget and `@llm/kill <npc>` reach a decision. It cannot be done at that
  call site: the worker lease it is handed (`mush_core::decision::DecisionWorkerLease`) is
  public-safe by design, "no world or private witness reference can cross the async boundary",
  and names a controller and a decision, not an object. Carrying an audit attribution on the
  lease is a change to that contract in `mush-core` and belongs to its own cut.
- **"The knowledge tiers the NPC was allowed"** is reported as a count of public facts and of
  recalled memories. The snapshot carries no other tier, so there is nothing else to report.

**Not built.** The record does not survive a restart (it is runtime state, like the mailbox).
It keeps one turn, not a history. It does not cover a summarise turn or a scene-turn decision
(`npc_decision`), only dialogue turns.

**Not pinned by a story.** A completion whose payload does not decode (the `Unreadable`
result) through `@agent/show`.
