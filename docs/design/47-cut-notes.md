# 47. The close-out — cut notes

One section a unit of [doc 47](47-close-out.md) §6. A unit's session replaces its own "Not built."
line with what it built, under these headings: **Survey**, **Built**, **Tests**, **Divergences**,
**Not built**. Each session edits only its own section, so two units' notes never touch the same
lines.

## CO.1

**Survey.** The typed word lived in one match arm in `field_commands.rs`, one in `directive_text`, six usage and refusal strings in `sortie/mod.rs` and `prepare.rs`, and two help pages (`field.md`, `detachments.md`). Nothing else parses the word: the mush-bot hits for `CONCENTRATE` are ore concentrate, a different thing. `FOCUS` collides with no other order word in the parser. `+focus` is a console command and never reaches the `ORDER` parser, whose verb is the second word of the line.

**Built.** `ORDER … <slot|ALL> FOCUS <contact>` does what `CONCENTRATE` did (R-47-1). `directive_text`, the usage and refusal constants (now `FOCUS_USAGE`, `FOCUS_UNIDENTIFIED`, `FOCUS_NO_CONTACT`, `FOCUS_NO_EXPIRY`) and both help pages say `FOCUS`. `CONCENTRATE` is still accepted, silently, as an alias, so nothing typed breaks; it is shown nowhere. The help's old paragraph on why the word was not `FOCUS` is replaced by a note that `+focus` is another command.

**Tests.** `co1_the_stored_variant_stays_concentrate`: a stored `{"kind":"concentrate",…}` reads back and re-encodes byte for byte. The `directive_text` unit test expects `FOCUS BK`. MW.14c's story (`field_mw14c.rs`) types `FOCUS`.

**Divergences.** None. The stored variant, `FieldObjective::Concentrate`, and the internal function and module names (`concentrate`, `Concentration`) keep their names: persisted bytes do not move, and an internal rename buys the player nothing.

**Not built.** Retiring the `CONCENTRATE` alias: it costs one comparison; drop it only if the owner wants the word gone.
